Welcome to my redesigned version of the classic **Pac-Man** game, now enhanced with cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques! Pac-Man, originally released by Namco in 1980, became a cultural icon due to its unique gameplay and simple yet addictive mechanics. In this project, Iâ€™ve brought Pac-Man into a modern context, incorporating a variety of AI algorithms to explore how they can enhance gameplay, decision-making, and strategic movement.

## Key Features:

### Redesigned Pac-Man: 
* In addition to implementing AI, I've redesigned the game environment to provide a fresh, modern experience while retaining the core elements of the original Pac-Man.

### Search Algorithms: 
* Implemented depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search, and A* search to navigate the Pac-Man world and solve optimization problems such as pathfinding and the traveling salesman problem.
  
### Multi-Agent Search: 
* Modeled Pac-Man as an adversarial agent against ghosts, leveraging minimax and expectimax algorithms to handle both deterministic and stochastic search scenarios. Additionally, custom evaluation functions are designed to improve Pac-Man's decision-making.
  
### Reinforcement Learning: 
* Applied both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning techniques. These were tested in simulated environments, including Pac-Man and a crawling robot, to refine action policies and optimize rewards over time.
  
### Probabilistic Inference (Ghostbusters): 
* Developed probabilistic models to infer the positions of hidden ghosts using a hidden Markov model, enabling Pac-Man to act strategically in uncertain environments through exact and approximate inference.



By combining the nostalgia of a retro game with advanced AI methodologies, this project offers both a tribute to the original Pac-Man and a demonstration of how artificial intelligence can revolutionize gameplay in interactive environments.
